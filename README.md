# Data_Visualization_Final_Project

This is the code for the final project for Fundamentals of Data Visualization taught at CU Boulder.

The data this analyzes is from the CMS open payments dataset which can be found here: https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/

This dataset it huge though so I limit it to:
Physicians
2022
Minnesota Only

The code to create the Final_Project_Data_Filter_And_Clean.csv file is called Final_Project_Data_Filter_And_Clean.ipynb

The code that creates the visualization is Final_Project_Data_Subset.ipynb

This code is then deployed to Heroku and can be viewed at the following link:
